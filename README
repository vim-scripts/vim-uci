Tiny, simple ftdetect, ftplugin and syntax scripts for OpenWRT's Unified Configuration Interface files.

Don't have vim on your router? I don't either, but this works great with sshfs.

# Bonus features

ftplugin/uci.vim sets commentstring correctly, so tpope's [vim-commentary](https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary) works as intended!
